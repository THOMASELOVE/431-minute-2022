# Minute Papers for 431 in Fall 2022

During the semester, Professor Love will set a series of "minute papers" which are brief surveys asking you to help us better understand how the class is going, and to let us remind you of some things. The first Minute Paper is due after Class 5.

After Class | due at NOON on | Link to Minute Paper Form | Link to Dr. Love's Feedback
----------: | ------: | :--------: | :----------:

- You'll need to be logged into Google via CWRU to complete the Minute Papers, or to review the feedback.
- Your **Lab Code** identifies you in the roster. Dr. Love sent your Lab Code via email on 2021-09-10. (The email's subject is **431 Lab Code - please save**.) 

## Deadlines and Late Work

- All Minute Paper deadlines are in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2022/calendar.html).
- Minute Papers that are between 1 and 12 hours late will receive 60% credit. Minute Papers that are more than 12 hours late will receive no credit.

## Course Participation Grades

Details on how course participation is evaluated are provided in [this section of our Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2022/assignments.html#class-participation). As indicated there, the most common ways to earn additional class participation besides the Minute Papers are:

1. completing "bonus" tasks Dr. Love offers during the semester, so keep your eyes open for these opportunities
2. asking and answering useful questions on Campuswise, and **in class sessions**, and 
3. finding typos in the materials and helping Dr. Love to fix them
